# discord-snip-integration
Detects Music coming from Snip (Snip Included). This Application supports whatever Snip supports

I personally like to thank **David Rudie** for allowing his source and binaries to be completely free.
This project contains version 5.3.1, which is the latest at this time. If there is an update, I'm sure I'll be on top of it, but if I'm not, then to obtain his new copy would be to visit [His Repository](https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip/)

My binaries for this application are my personal builds, to ensure they are 100% legitimate. You can find them in my [project's folder](http://downloads.toasternetwork.com/DiscordProjects)

Currently there's an internal updater which is nice and all, and it doesn't take up much lines, but I do feel that it can be improved.
