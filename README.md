# discord-snip-integration
Detects Music coming from Snip (Snip Included). This Application supports whatever Snip supports
**Good news everybody!** DSI can now use Snip externally! This means that we read from the snip.txt file, but this method has been optimized so we don't constantly read from disk. The only problem that this can be is having the *Symbol Garbage* from the snip.txt, and also it not clearing out which makes the song you were just listening to stick to the bar.

Another thing to note, [ToasterNetwork](https://toasternetwork.com) is back, which means I can continue making something, (if I have the time)

I personally like to thank **David Rudie** for allowing his source and binaries to be completely free.
This project contains version 5.3.1, which is the latest at this time. If there is an update, I'm sure I'll be on top of it, but if I'm not, then to obtain his new copy would be to visit [His Repository](https://github.com/dlrudie/Snip/)

My binaries for this application are my personal builds, to ensure they are 100% legitimate. You can find them in my [project's folder](http://downloads.toasternetwork.com/DiscordProjects)

Currently there's an internal updater which is nice and all, and it doesn't take up much lines, but I do feel that it can be improved.

Any ***Issues*** with the program, or compiling on your end, please submit an issue and I or someone else will jump on it. I'm not that kind of prick that doesn't answer to the community. I love you all! :D
